## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**bank_account** | [**models::BankAccount**](BankAccount.md) |  | 
**bank_account_number** | **String** | This field would be used to populate the bank account number of the destination payment method. The field is intentionally not included in any other Schemas since Amazon internal systems will never receive it in unencrypted format, so field won't be part of the request signature  |
